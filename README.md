Quickly create Google Calendar events from plain text.

[Quick Add][article] was a Google Calendar feature that existed circa 2012 that allowed creating calendar events from natural language text input. I loved it and they deprecated it from me ☹️.

This is my attempt to recreate Quick Add in Python. My goal is to eventual put this in a webpage.

## Usage

`rip_quick_add.py`:
1. Takes a text input,
2. parses the input to find date info, and then
3. returns a Google Calendar URL for add the event to your calendar.
